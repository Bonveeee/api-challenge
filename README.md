# Overview
We well provide you with a JSON file that represents an object. You will be in a race with your peers to deliver a working HATEOAS compliant API which allows CRUD operation on that object. We will specify a set of fields which you will have to search for the objects by.

# Rules
* You are expected to work on this task unassisted.
* You are allowed to bring your own scaffolding code
* The more cloud native and AWS based the solution is the more points you will score
* You are allowed to use the DB of your choice to back the API
* Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will score extra points but is not mandatory
* The solution should be demostrable on AWS or on your local machine (If you do not manage to deploy it to AWS).
* The more cloud native, secure,cost efficient, performant and reliable the solution is the more points you will score.

Follow on questions:
1.	Is there CI/CD?
2.	What compromises did you make?
3.	How do you ensure id uniqueness?
4.	How did you implement address sequence?
